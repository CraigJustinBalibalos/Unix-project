 Unix Project

Project goals:
Create a Web Server that provides information on a certain topic.

Platform choice:
We will use VPS for our server.

Requirements:
1) Set up multiple accounts: The server host will make accounts using the terminal and the 
other users will connect using those accounts.
2) Process the service management: We will check for updates on the services that we 
used by software such as cacti, mrtg, or munin.
3) Basic Security System: Configure the server to make it HTTPS. Also, generate SSH keys to 
connect to the server.
4) Automated Tasks: Write a script to show the date and time to the user (Not final: Write 
a script to check for updates for services used and install them).

Major technical solutions compared:

We will be comparing different Linux distributions, VPS providers, servers such as (Nginx, 
Apache) and software needed for managing the webserver.

VPS Provider: We might use AWS or Google Cloud Computing Services since they have free 
trials.

Linux Distribution: For now, we think we will be using Ubuntu. It depends if the chosen distro 
will be compatible with our project.

Web Server Software: We will be using Nginx or Apache.

Timeline:

Week 12 – Edit Team Project Proposal, work on the journal, and create the Git repository and 
choose the VPS provider.

Week 13 – Request the service from the VPS provider, create the webserver using the Web 
Server Software and create multiple accounts.

Week 14 – Create the basic security system for the Web Server and make a script that 
automates tasks in the Web Server.

Week 15 – Finish the project and prepare for Oral Presentation.
