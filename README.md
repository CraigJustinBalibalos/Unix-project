<h2>We are doing a project where we create a VPS server and deploy the web server which will show our website with some webpages. </h2>

# Project goals:

Create a Web Server that provides information on a certain topic.

# Platform choice:

We will use VPS for our server.

# Requirements:

1. Set up multiple accounts: The server host will make accounts using the terminal and the
   other users will connect using those accounts.
2. Process the service management: We will check for updates on the services that we
   used by software such as cacti, mrtg, or munin.
3. Basic Security System: Configure the server to make it HTTPS. Also, generate SSH keys to
   connect to the server.
4. Automated Tasks: Write a script to show the date and time to the user (Not final: Write
   a script to check for updates for services used and install them).

# Major technical solutions compared:

We will be comparing different Linux distributions, VPS providers, servers such as (Nginx,
Apache) and software needed for managing the webserver.

# VPS Provider:

We might use AWS or Google Cloud Computing Services since they have free
trials.

# Linux Distribution:

For now, we think we will be using Ubuntu. It depends if the chosen distro
will be compatible with our project.

Web Server Software: We will be using Nginx or Apache.

# Timeline:

Week 12 â€“ Edit Team Project Proposal, work on the journal, and create the Git repository and
choose the VPS provider.

Week 13 â€“ Request the service from the VPS provider, create the webserver using the Web
Server Software and create multiple accounts.

Week 14 â€“ Create the basic security system for the Web Server and make a script that
automates tasks in the Web Server.

Week 15 â€“ Finish the project and prepare for Oral Presentation.
